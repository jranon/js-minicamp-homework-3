# Homework #3

## Instructions
---
1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.
		
	* Objects
  
  objects contain values paired with non-numeric keys called properties.  These are contained within curly brackets.
  
	* Properties
  
  properties are the key values in objects.  These are often used to call a certain value if the property is known.
  
	* Methods
  
  methods are functions that are part of an object.
  
	* for in loop
  
  the for... in loop iterates through the properties of an object, for (var `property` in `object`).
  
	* dot notation vs bracket notation
  
  dot notation and bracket notation can both be used to call or create properties in an object.  bracket notation is best used when applying a variable to a property of an array, as functions often take strings as arguments (bracket notation uses and applies a string to the object), and dot notation is to be used only if a property is known, or with the intention to create a property named as the part to the right of the dot.


2. Fork and clone this repo.  When you need to commit use the following commands.

	* git status
	* git commit -m "your commit message"
